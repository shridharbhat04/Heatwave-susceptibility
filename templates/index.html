            <section>
                <h2>What is a Heatwave?</h2>
                <p>A heatwave is a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity. These extreme temperatures are considered dangerous and can pose severe health risks. Heatwaves are characterized by temperatures significantly higher than the usual climate for a specific area. The duration of a heatwave can vary, but typically it lasts for several consecutive days.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Impact of Heatwaves</h2>
                <p>Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to the global climate crisis. They pose a variety of risks to both human health and the environment. Here are some key impacts:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Health Risks:</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Heat Stress and Stroke:</strong> Extended exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, dehydration, and even death.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respiratory and Cardiovascular Strain:</strong> The combination of heat and air pollution worsens respiratory issues like asthma and heart conditions, especially among vulnerable populations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vulnerable Groups:</strong> Elderly people, children, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and outdoor workers are particularly susceptible to heat-related illnesses.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><span class="highlight">Environmental Effects:</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Droughts and Water Shortages:</strong> Heatwaves often lead to reduced rainfall, causing droughts and significant water scarcity, which negatively impacts agriculture and local ecosystems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wildfires:</strong> High temperatures can ignite wildfires, leading to massive environmental destruction and loss of life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agricultural Loss:</strong> Crops suffer from high temperatures, resulting in lower agricultural yields and higher food prices.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><span class="highlight">Economic Consequences:</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Demands:</strong> The demand for air conditioning and cooling systems increases dramatically, which may strain energy supplies and increase electricity costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Healthcare System Burden:</strong> Hospitals and healthcare systems face increased demand during heatwaves, dealing with a surge in patients with heat-related illnesses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Factors Contributing to Increased Heatwave Frequency</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Human-induced climate change, primarily caused by carbon emissions from industries, deforestation, and transportation, is leading to rising global temperatures. As the planet heats up, so does the frequency of heatwaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urban Heat Islands:</strong> Cities tend to trap more heat due to their dense infrastructure and concrete surfaces. These areas often experience much higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Climate models predict that many regions will experience more frequent and intense heatwaves due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How to Mitigate Heatwave Risks?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong> Implementing heatwave early warning systems can help communities prepare in advance by providing alerts about extreme temperature events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling Centers:</strong> Establishing community cooling centers can provide refuge for vulnerable populations during heatwaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Green Spaces:</strong> Urban greening projects like planting trees, creating parks, and building green rooftops can help cool cities and reduce the urban heat island effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating the public about the risks of heatwaves and how to stay hydrated, cool, and safe during extreme temperatures is crucial for reducing health impacts.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Heatwave Susceptibility Score (HSS)</h2>
                <p>In this visualization tool, we present the <span class="highlight">Heatwave Susceptibility Score (HSS)</span> for different regions and states. This score evaluates a regionâ€™s vulnerability to heatwaves based on factors such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature variability</li>
                    <li>Air pollution levels</li>
                    <li>Groundwater sustainability</li>
                    <li>Population density</li>
                    <li>Healthcare system accessibility</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Higher scores indicate regions that are more at risk for extreme heat events. This information helps local governments and communities better prepare and mitigate the potential impacts of heatwaves.</p>
